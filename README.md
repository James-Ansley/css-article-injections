# CSS Injections

Some CSS injections which aim to achieve distraction-free article reading.
Consider using with a CSS injector plugin like
[CustomCSS](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/customcss-injector/).

These are intended to make articles (which can be linked to in RSS feeds) look
nice and may break some non-article site-wide styles.

I plan to add to these over time.
