# CSS Article Injections

Some CSS injections that aim to achieve distraction-free article reading.
Consider using with a CSS injector plugin like 
[Stylebot](https://stylebot.dev/).

These are intended to make articles (which can be linked to in RSS feeds) look
nice and may break some non-article site-wide styles.

I plan to add to these over time.
